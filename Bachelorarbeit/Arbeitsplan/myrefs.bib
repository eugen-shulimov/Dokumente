	abstract = {As a product line evolves over time, variability realizations become overly complex and difficult to understand. This causes practical challenges in product line maintenance. To solve this issue, the VITAL tool is developed to automatically extract a variability reflexion model from variability code and conduct further analyses. In this paper, variability code analysis process using the VITAL tool is introduced, and each step of the analysis is demonstrated with an example product line.},
